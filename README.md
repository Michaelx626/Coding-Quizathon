 <h1 align="center"> Coding Quizathon </h1>

<h2 align="center"> Project Description </h2>
<p align="center"> This project is a test that measures the user's knowledge of coding. There are 5 simple coding questions that will be timed. The timer will begin at 30 seconds and with each incorrect answer, the timer reduces by 5 seconds. Once the user completes the quizathon, he or she is able to enter his or her initials and keep track of his or her high school. The user may also clear the high school whenever he or she wishes. This project helped me understand the storing data in the local storage, using a bunch of querySelectors, getElementbyID, and much more. I was able to comfortably use event listeners along with creating multiple functions to perform multiple tasks. It was absolutely amazing!</p>
